# Lendsqr Frontend Engineering Test

This is my implementation of the Lendsqr frontend engineering assessment.  
The project was built using **React + TypeScript + SCSS** with mock APIs and unit testing.

---

## Features
- **Login Page** â€“ Authentication UI (mock login via `mockApi.ts`)
- **Dashboard** â€“ Overview layout (sidebar, header, statcards)
- **Users Page** â€“ Paginated users table with filtering and status badges
- **User Details Page** â€“ Full profile details pulled from mock API.

---

## Tech Stack
- **React (Vite + TS)** â€“ Frontend framework
- **SCSS** â€“ Styles with variables & mixins for responsive design
- **React Router** â€“ Navigation between pages
- **Vitest + React Testing Library** â€“ Unit testing for components and API flows
- **Mock API (`src/utils/mockApi.ts`)** â€“ Generates 500 users and exposes async functions

## Testing

## Responsiveness

* Designed to match the Figma pixel-perfect layouts.
* Fully responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints using SCSS media queries.

## Notes

* Instead of external tools like json-server, I used a custom mockApi.ts for this project for simplicity and better test control.
